## 🚀 QUICK EXPLOIT EXECUTION

```bash
# Setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd oly-security-vulnerabilities/exploits
npm install && npx hardhat compile

# Start test network (separate terminal)
npx hardhat node

# Run critical exploits
npx hardhat run DoSExploit.js --network localhost          # Protocol DoS
npx hardhat run RoleBypassExploit.js --network localhost   # Fee Bypass  
npx hardhat run ReentrancyExploit.js --network localhost   # Reentrancy

# Run all exploits
node RunAllExploits.js
```
